**Problem Statement**:  
  
Our project aims to solve the problem of easily managing and tracking tasks for a team.  
  
**Solution Approach**:  
  
We have developed a web application using Node.js and Express that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks. The application uses MongoDB for data persistence and provides a RESTful API for interacting with the tasks.  
  
The application is designed with a user-friendly interface and allows for easy collaboration among team members.
